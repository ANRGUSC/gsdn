GCNScheduler for Dynamic Networks

This repo contains code for training a GCN to imitate the HEFT scheduling algorithm, resulting in the ability to rapidly compute schedules for distributing complex tasks across large, dynamic networks.

The simulation environment simulates robots patrolling the perimeter of arbitrary polygons with noisy inter-robot communication.
